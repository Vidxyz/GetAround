# GetAround
Explore exhibits and locations around you directed by collections of estimote beacons. Never again have to lean in to read more about an exhibit or rent out an audio guide. Be it a museum, an aquarium, or a supermarket, just pull out your phone to discover locations near you and learn more about them with just a few taps on your screen.

Currently not supporting a database, edit the data.json file to your preferences for relaying particular information about beacons in the vicinity.
